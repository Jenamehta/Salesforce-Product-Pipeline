# Salesforce-Product-Pipeline
Create a product pipeline dashboard with analytics chart
## OBJECTIVE
I would like to derive meaningful insights by creating a dashboard for the questions below from the dataset(csv file)
- A breakdown of the current product pipeline by stage
- Information on the geographic distribution of opportunities
- A comparison of the different products by opportunity values

## STEPS
- Load a CSV file into Analytics and create a dataset from that file
- Choose the right data for what you're trying to communicate
- Find the best chart for visualizing your data
- Create the appropriate exploration (or lens) for the chart
